    -----
    Available model options (fnames) are as follows:

      - 'cogent-no-finetune.pt' : the same as 'clevr.pt' trained on CoGenT A without fine-tuning
      - 'cogent-finetuned.pt' : the same as above trained on CoGenT A and fine-tuned on CoGenT B
      - 'clevr-reg.pt' : trained on CLEVR with 14x14 feature maps using regularization
      - 'cogent-no-finetune-reg.pt' : the same as above trained on CoGenT A without fine-tuning
      - 'cogent-finetuned-reg.pt' : the same as above trained on CoGenT A and fine-tuned on B
      - 'clevr-reg-hres.pt' : trained on CLEVR with 28x28 feature maps and regularization
      - 'program_generator.pt' : the program generator; see 'generate_programs.py'
